# AI-Powered README Generator 💡

This AI-powered tool makes it easy to create a professional README file for your GitHub project. Instead of writing the README yourself, you simply enter a basic description of your project, and the AI automatically formats it into a clean, organized file. It adds sections like the project name, features, installation instructions, and more, all optimized for GitHub. This saves you time and ensures your README looks polished and ready for others to understand and use your project!
